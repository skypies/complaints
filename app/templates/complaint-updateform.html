        <p> Here are the raw details about flight identification; it might
          list the flight you're looking for. The system takes the raw
          data, adjusts for how stale the positions are, filters out
          flights that don't have flightnumbers, figures out how far
          they are from you, and then sees if there is an obvious
          flight to blame.<br/>

          A brief explanation of the fields:<br/>
          <b>3Dist</b>: 3D distance, taking altitude/elevation into account<br/>
          <b>2Dist</b>: 2D distance from aircraft latlong to yours<br/>
          <b>Brng</b>: the bearing from your latlong to the aircraft<br/>
          <b>Hdng</b>: The direction the aircraft was pointing in<br/>
          <b>Alt</b>: The pressure altitude (in feet; not physical altitude !)<br/>
          <b>Speed</b>: The groundspeed (in knots; not airspeed !)<br/>
          <b>VertSpd</b>: The vertical speed (feet per minute))<br/>
          <b>Equp</b>: The kind of aircraft (Airbus 320, etc)<br/>
          <b>Flight</b>: The IATA scheduled flightnumber (or callsign, for Surf Air)<br/>
          <b>Orig:Dest</b>: Origin:Destination airport codes, if we have them<br/>
          <b>IcaoID</b>: The hex identifier of the physical aircraft<br/>
          <b>Callsign</b>: Which callsign the aircraft was broadcasting under<br/>
          <b>Source</b>: Which data system provided the position data<br/>
          <b>Age</b>: How long since the position was generated<br/>
          <br/>Flightnumbers that look like r:N123AB - these are unscheduled flights, even though they're sometimes big jets being moved around by the airlines. I filter these out, as they ruin the accuracy.
