        <p> Here are the raw details about flight identification; it might
          list the flight you're looking for. A brief explanation:<br/>
          <b>3Dist</b>: 3D distance, taking altitude into account<br/>
          <b>2Dist</b>: 2D distance from aircraft latlong to yours<br/>
          <b>Brng</b>: the bearing from your latlong to the aircraft<br/>
          <b>Hdng</b>: The direction the aircraft was pointing in<br/>
          <b>Alt</b>: The pressure altitude (not physical altitude !)<br/>
          <b>Speed</b>: The groundspeed (not airspeed !)<br/>
          <b>Equip</b>: The kind of aircraft (Airbus 320, etc)<br/>
          <b>Orig</b>: Origin airport, if we have it<br/>
          <b>Dest</b>: Destination airport, if we have it<br/>
          <b>IcaoID</b>: The hex identifier of the physical aircraft<br/>
          <b>Source</b>: Which data system provided the position data<br/>
          <b>Age</b>: How long since the position was generated<br/>
          <br/>Flightnumbers that look like r:N123AB - these are unscheduled flights, even though they're sometimes big jets being moved around by the airlines. I filter these out, as they ruin the accuracy.
